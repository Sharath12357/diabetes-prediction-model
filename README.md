# Diabetes Prediction

This project is a **machine learning model** for predicting diabetes using **Logistic Regression**.  
The model is trained on a dataset with features related to medical and health data, and it uses **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.  

âœ… **Main Features:**
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification (diabetes vs. no diabetes)
- Accuracy score metric to evaluate performance
- Trained model saved using `pickle` for easy loading and reuse
- Uses `imbalanced-learn` (`SMOTE`) for balancing the dataset
